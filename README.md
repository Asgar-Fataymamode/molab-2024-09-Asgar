# Football Match Simulation in Swift

## Overview

Over several hours this week (around **5 hours**), I have been learning the **Swift programming language**. Specifically, I've focused on understanding syntax, functions, and how to structure simple projects.

### Resources I've Used:
- [Swift Guided Tour Documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/)
- [Quick Swift Tutorial by YouTube (CodeWithChris)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5X_V81OYnQ&t=604s&pp=ygUUc3dpZnQgcXVpY2sgdHV0b3JpYWw%3D)
- [Another Swift Basics Video Tutorial (CodeWithChris)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwA1VWP0Ldw&pp=ygUUc3dpZnQgcXVpY2sgdHV0b3JpYWw%3D)

## **Project: Football Match Simulation**

### Description:
This project is a **Football Match Simulator** built in Swift using **Xcode Playground**. The project simulates a full football match where goals, fouls, and cards are randomly generated. The game tracks and displays the score in real-time and includes visual animations like goal celebrations and showing yellow or red cards for fouls.

### Features:
- **Randomized match events**: goals, fouls, and no event occurrences.
- **Displays the current score** after each goal.
- **Goal celebration animation** with emojis.
- **Yellow and red card display** for fouls.
- **Real-time event simulation** with a delay.

### What I Learned from the Project:
- How to structure and organize a Swift project.
- Handling arrays and looping through data structures to simulate events.
- Using emojis to create fun animations within the console.
- Applying Swift functions with parameters to simulate complex events.
- Understanding how to push and organize projects on GitHub.
