# Week 1 - Football Match Simulation in Swift

## Overview

Over several hours this week (around **5 hours**), I have been learning the **Swift programming language**. Specifically, I've focused on understanding syntax, functions, and how to structure simple projects.

### Resources I've Used:
- [Swift Guided Tour Documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/)
- [Quick Swift Tutorial by YouTube (CodeWithChris)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5X_V81OYnQ&t=604s&pp=ygUUc3dpZnQgcXVpY2sgdHV0b3JpYWw%3D)

## **Project: Football Match Simulation**

### Description:
This project is a **Football Match Simulator** built in Swift using **Xcode Playground**. The project simulates a full football match where goals, fouls, and cards are randomly generated. The game tracks and displays the score in real-time and includes visual animations like goal celebrations and showing yellow or red cards for fouls.

### Features:
- **Randomized match events**: goals, fouls, and no event occurrences.
- **Displays the current score** after each goal.
- **Goal celebration animation** with emojis.
- **Yellow and red card display** for fouls.
- **Real-time event simulation** with a delay.

### What I Learned from the Project:
- How to structure and organize a Swift project.
- Handling arrays and looping through data structures to simulate events.
- Using emojis to create fun animations within the console.
- Applying Swift functions with parameters to simulate complex events.
- Understanding how to push and organize projects on GitHub.


# Week 2 - Football ASCII Image Display

## Overview

This week, I spent around **3 hours** continuing to learn **Swift**. I built upon the foundational knowledge I gained in Week 1 and applied it to a new project. This project focused on loading and displaying images created using ASCII text in a Swift Playground. 

### Description:
The task was to display a series of football-related ASCII images in order, with descriptions preceding each image. The ASCII art files (like the stadium, players, and goal) were stored in a resources folder, and the playground loads and displays them sequentially.

### Features:
- **Sequential display of ASCII images** representing a football match.
- **Descriptions** are shown before each image, providing context.
- **Images sourced from the resources folder**: ASCII files were loaded dynamically and displayed.
- **Simple code structure**: Functions were used to read from text files and print ASCII art to the console.

### What I Learned from the Project:
- How to organize external resources (like `.txt` files) in an Xcode Playground.
- Loading and displaying data (ASCII art) from external text files in Swift.
- Using Swift functions to handle repetitive tasks such as displaying text and images in sequence.


# Week 3 - # Football Random Facts App

## Overview
The **Football Clubs and Random Facts App** is a simple SwiftUI-based application that displays random football facts and images for some of the most famous football clubs in the world. 

## Features
- **Random Fact Generation**: Each football club has a list of facts and corresponding images. When the user selects a club and presses the **"Generate Random Fact"** button, a random fact about the club is displayed alongside an image.
- **Clubs Included**: The app includes the following football clubs:
  - Chelsea
  - Manchester United
  - Liverpool
  - Arsenal
 
# Week 4 - Football Trivia Game

## Overview
The **Football Trivia Game** is an application that challenges users with trivia questions related to both **club-level** and **international football**. 

## Features
- **Club and International Trivia**: The app offers two categories of trivia questions: **Club Level Trivia** and **International Level Trivia**. Users can select their preferred category from the home screen.
- **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Each trivia question provides users with **four possible answers**. Users must select the correct answer to proceed to the next question.
- **Images for Context**: Each trivia question is accompanied by an image relevant to the topic, enhancing user engagement.
- **Countdown Timer**: A **15-second countdown timer** is displayed for each question, challenging users to respond quickly before time runs out.
- **Correct and Incorrect Feedback**: Upon selecting an answer, the correct answer is highlighted in **green** and incorrect answers in **red**, giving immediate visual feedback.
- **Game Over and Celebration Screens**: If a user answers all questions correctly, a **congratulations message** with a **confetti animation** is displayed. If the user runs out of time or selects an incorrect answer, they are presented with a **Game Over** message.
- **Restart Option**: After completing the trivia (either by winning or losing), users are presented with an option to **restart** and play again.

# Week 5 - Updated Football Trivia Game

## Overview
The **Football Trivia Game** is an application that challenges users with trivia questions related to both **club-level** and **international football**. 

## Features
- Improved Football Trivia Game, with high scores and achievements, showcasing data storage
